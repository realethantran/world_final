## Diary Entry

<html>
<p style="font-size: 10pt">Dear Diary,</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt">...One of the most significant effects of trench warfare is the psychological toll it takes on us soldiers. I have seen so many men break down and cry, and it's not just because of the physical pain they are experiencing. Being constantly exposed to danger and violence can lead to feelings of fear, anxiety, and depression. The uncertainty of when the next attack will come, and whether we will survive it, can wear down even the bravest of men...</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt">...constant exposure to [the] elements has caused many of us to suffer from frostbite or heatstroke, depending on the time of year. I've seen so many of my fellow soldiers suffering from these ailments. It's heartbreaking to see them in such pain and knowing that there's nothing I can do to help...</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt">...Trench warfare has shaped our experiences on the Western Front in more ways than I can count. It has taken a toll on our bodies, our minds, and our relationships with each other. But we soldiers continue to fight on, because we know that our sacrifices are necessary for the greater good</p>

This environment could lead to diseases such as trench foot and dysentery...</p>
